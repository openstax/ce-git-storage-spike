The modular approach and richness of content ensure that the book meets the needs of a variety of courses. College Algebra offers a wealth of examples with detailed, conceptual explanations, building a strong foundation in the material before asking students to apply what they&#8217;ve learned.</p></section><section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"eip-250\"><h3 data-type=\"title\">Coverage and Scope</h3><p id=\"eip-id1164242457359\">In determining the concepts, skills, and topics to cover, we engaged dozens of highly experienced instructors with a range of student audiences.  The resulting scope and sequence proceeds logically while allowing for a significant amount of flexibility in instruction.  </p><p id=\"eip-id1164239746735\">Chapters 1 and 2 provide both a review and foundation for study of functions that begins in Chapter 3.  The authors recognize that while some institutions may find this material a prerequisite, other institutions have told us that they have a cohort that need the prerequisite skills built into the course.\n</p><ul id=\"eip-id1168983371474\" data-bullet-style=\"none\"><li>Chapter 1: Prerequisites</li>\n<li>Chapter 2: Equations and Inequalities</li></ul><p id=\"eip-id1164253943954\">Chapters 3-6: The Algebraic Functions\n</p><ul id=\"eip-id7864342\" data-bullet-style=\"none\"><li>Chapter 3: Functions</li>\n<li>Chapter 4: Linear Functions</li>\n<li>Chapter 5: Polynomial and Rational Functions</li>\n<li>Chapter 6: Exponential and Logarithm Functions</li></ul></section><p id=\"eip-313\">Chapters 7-9: Further Study in College Algebra\n</p><ul id=\"eip-id1165670230619\" data-bullet-style=\"none\"><li>Chapter 7: Systems of Equations and Inequalities</li>\n<li>Chapter 8: Analytic Geometry</li>\n<li>Chapter 9: Sequences, Probability, and Counting Theory</li></ul><section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"eip-350\"><h3 data-type=\"title\">Development Overview</h3><p id=\"eip-377\"><em data-effect=\"italics\">College Algebra</em> is the product of a collaborative effort by a group of dedicated authors, editors, and instructors whose collective passion for this project has resulted in a text that is remarkably unified in purpose and voice. Special thanks is due to our Lead Author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University, who provided the overall vision for the book and oversaw the development of each and every chapter, drawing up the initial blueprint, reading numerous drafts, and assimilating field reviews into actionable revision plans for our authors and editors. </p><p id=\"eip-id1170058262242\">The collective experience of our author team allowed us to pinpoint the subtopics, exceptions, and individual connections that give students the most trouble.  The textbook is therefore replete with well-designed features and highlights, which help students overcome these barriers.  As the students read and practice, they are coached in methods of thinking through problems and internalizing mathematical processes.  </p></section><section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"eip-42\"><h3 data-type=\"title\">Accuracy of the Content</h3><p id=\"eip-951\">We understand that precision and accuracy are imperatives in mathematics, and undertook a dedicated accuracy program led by experienced faculty.  </p><ol id=\"eip-345\" type=\"1\"><li>Each chapter&#8217;s manuscript underwent rounds of review and revision by a panel of active instructors.</li>\n<li>Then, prior to publication, a separate team of experts checked all text, examples, and graphics for mathematical accuracy; multiple reviewers were assigned to each chapter to minimize the chances of any error escaping notice.</li>\n<li>A third team of experts was responsible for the accuracy of the Answer Key, dutifully re-working every solution to eradicate any lingering errors. Finally, the editorial team conducted a multi-round post-production review to ensure the integrity of the content in its final form.</li></ol></section><section data-depth=\"1\" id=\"eip-563\"><h3 data-type=\"title\">Pedagogical Foundations and Features</h3><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-61\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Learning Objectives</h4><p id=\"eip-86\">Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional element\n</p></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-719\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Narrative text</h4><p id=\"eip-784\">\nNarrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples.  Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:\n</p><ul id=\"eip-id1166658637533\"><li>Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.</li>\n<li>Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.</li>\n</ul></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-802\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Examples</h4><p id=\"eip-321\">Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples that demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. The multiple Examples model different approaches to the same type of problem or introduce similar problems of increasing complexity. </p><p id=\"eip-id1166796259369\">All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. The question clearly lays out a mathematical problem to solve.  The Solution walks through the steps, usually providing context for the approach &#8212; in other words, why the instructor is solving the problem in a specific manner.  Finally, the Analysis (for select examples)  reflects  on the broader implications of the Solution just shown. Examples are followed by a &#8220;Try It&#8221; question, as explained below. </p></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-236\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Figures</h4><p id=\"eip-829\"><em data-effect=\"italics\">College Algebra</em> contains many figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.\n</p><span data-type=\"media\" id=\"preface01\" data-alt=\"Example figure\">\n\n  <img src=\"/resources/73a7944f1a6253e4cc8726cc09e92801c34c9d76/CNX_Precalc_Figure_01_01_012.jpg\" data-media-type=\"image/jpeg\" alt=\"Example figure\"/>\n\n</span></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-22\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Supporting Features</h4><p id=\"eip-id7251558\">Four unobtrusive but important features, each marked by a distinctive icon, contribute to and check understanding.</p>\n<ul id=\"eip-id1167601990420\" data-bullet-style=\"none\"><li>\nA <strong>How To</strong> is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.   </li>\n\n<li>A <strong>Try It</strong> exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem. In the PDF and the Web View version of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key.</li>\n\n<li>A <strong>Q&amp;A</strong> may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.  </li>\n\n<li>The <strong>Media</strong> icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section. </li>\n</ul><p id=\"eip-473\">While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany <em data-effect=\"italics\">College Algebra</em>. </p></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-166\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Section Exercises</h4><p id=\"eip-526\">Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used selectively for guided practice. With over 4600 exercises across the 9 chapters, instructors should have plenty from which to choose.<sup data-type=\"footnote-number\" id=\"footnote-ref1\"><a data-type=\"footnote-link\" href=\"#footnote1\">1</a></sup>\n</p><p id=\"eip-96\">Section Exercises are organized by question type, and generally appear in the following order:\n</p><ul id=\"eip-id8611023\" data-bullet-style=\"none\"><li><strong>Verbal</strong> questions assess conceptual understanding of key terms and concepts.</li>\n<li><strong>Algebraic</strong> problems require students to apply algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the section.</li>\n<li><strong>Graphical</strong> problems assess students&#8217; ability to interpret or produce a graph.</li>\n<li><strong>Numeric</strong> problems require the student to perform calculations or computations.</li>\n<li><strong>Technology</strong> problems encourage exploration through use of a graphing utility, either to visualize or verify algebraic results or to solve problems via an alternative to the methods demonstrated in the section.</li>\n<li><strong>Extensions</strong> pose problems more challenging than the Examples demonstrated in the section. They require students to synthesize multiple learning objectives or apply critical thinking to solve complex problems.</li>\n<li><strong>Real-World Applications</strong> present realistic problem scenarios from fields such as physics, geology, biology, finance, and the social sciences.</li></ul></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-82\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Chapter Review Features</h4><p id=\"eip-33\">Each chapter concludes with a review of the most important takeaways, as well as additional practice problems that students can use to prepare for exams.\n\n</p><ul id=\"eip-id1170356513666\" data-bullet-style=\"none\"><li><strong>Key Terms</strong> provides a formal definition for each bold-faced term in the chapter. </li>\n<li><strong>Key Equations</strong> presents a compilation of formulas, theorems, and standard-form equations. </li>\n<li><strong>Key Concepts</strong> summarizes the most important ideas introduced in each section, linking back to the relevant Example(s) in case students need to review.</li>\n<li><strong>Chapter Review Exercises</strong> include 40-80 practice problems that recall the most important concepts from each section.</li>\n<li><strong>Practice Test</strong> includes 25-50 problems assessing the most important learning objectives from the chapter. Note that the practice test is not organized by section, and may be more heavily weighted toward cumulative objectives as opposed to the foundational objectives covered in the opening sections. </li>\n<li><strong>Answer Key</strong> includes the answers to all Try It exercises and every other exercise from the Section Exercises, Chapter Review Exercises, and Practice Test.</li></ul></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-365\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">Additional Resources</h4><section data-depth=\"3\" id=\"eip-242\"><h5 data-type=\"title\">Student and Instructor Resources</h5><p id=\"eip-826\">We&#8217;ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, an instructor solution manual, and PowerPoint slides.
