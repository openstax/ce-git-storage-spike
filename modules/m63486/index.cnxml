Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 20 books for college and AP courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. Our adaptive learning technology, designed to improve learning outcomes through personalized educational paths, is being piloted in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.</para></section>

The modular approach and the richness of content ensures that the book meets the needs of a variety of courses. <emphasis effect="italics">Algebra and Trigonometry</emphasis> offers a wealth of examples with detailed, conceptual explanations, building a strong foundation in the material before asking students to apply what they’ve learned.</para><section id="eip-250"><title>Coverage and Scope</title><para id="eip-id1164242457359">In determining the concepts, skills, and topics to cover, we engaged dozens of highly experienced instructors with a range of student audiences.

The authors recognize that while some institutions may find this material a prerequisite, other institutions have told us that they have a cohort that needs the prerequisite skills built into the course.

Special thanks is due to our Lead Author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University, who provided the overall vision for the book and oversaw the development of each and every chapter, drawing up the initial blueprint, reading numerous drafts, and assimilating field reviews into actionable revision plans for our authors and editors. </para><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-30">The collective experience of our author team allowed us to pinpoint the subtopics, exceptions, and individual connections that give students the most trouble.  The textbook is therefore replete with well-designed features and highlights which help students overcome these barriers.  As the students read and practice, they are coached in methods of thinking through problems and internalizing mathematical processes.  </para></section><section id="eip-42"><title>Accuracy of the Content</title><para id="eip-951">We understand that precision and accuracy are imperatives in mathematics, and undertook a dedicated accuracy program led by experienced faculty.</para><list id="eip-793" list-type="enumerated" number-style="arabic"><item>Each chapter’s manuscript underwent rounds of review and revision by a panel of active instructors.</item>
<item>Then, prior to publication, a separate team of experts checked all text, examples, and graphics for mathematical accuracy; multiple reviewers were assigned to each chapter to minimize the chances of any error escaping notice.</item>
<item>A third team of experts was responsible for the accuracy of the Answer Key, dutifully re-working every solution to eradicate any lingering errors. Finally, the editorial team conducted a multi-round post-production review to ensure the integrity of the content in its final form.</item></list></section><section id="eip-563"><title>Pedagogical Foundations and Features</title><section id="eip-61"><title>Learning Objectives</title><para id="eip-86">
Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional element 
</para></section><section id="eip-719"><title>Narrative text</title><para id="eip-784">
Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples.  Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:
<list xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-id1166658637533"><item>Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.</item>
<item>Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.</item>
</list></para></section><section id="eip-802"><title>Examples</title><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-321">Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples, that demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. The multiple Examples model different approaches to the same type of problem, or introduce similar problems of increasing complexity. </para><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-id1166796259369">All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. The question clearly lays out a mathematical problem to solve.  The Solution walks through the steps, usually providing context for the approach—in other words, why the instructor is solving the problem in a specific manner.  Finally, the Analysis (for select Examples) reflects  on the broader implications of the Solution just shown. Examples are followed by a Try It question, as explained below.  
</para></section><section id="eip-236"><title>Figures</title><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-829"><emphasis effect="italics">Algebra and Trigonometry</emphasis> contains figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.

A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.</item>

<item>A <emphasis>“Try It”</emphasis> exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem.  In the PDF and the Web View version of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key.</item>


<item>A <emphasis>Q&amp;A</emphasis> may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.</item>
