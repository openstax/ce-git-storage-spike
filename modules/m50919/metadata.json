OpenStax is committed to remaining transparent about all updates, so you will also find a list of past errata changes on your book page on openstax.org.</p></section><section data-depth=\"3\" id=\"eip-788\"><h5 data-type=\"title\">Format</h5><p id=\"eip-542\">\nYou can access this textbook for free in web view or PDF through openstax.org, and for a low cost in print.</p></section></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-626\"><h4 data-type=\"title\">About <em data-effect=\"italics\">Precalculus</em></h4><p id=\"eip-428\"><em data-effect=\"italics\">Precalculus</em> is adaptable and designed to fit the needs of a variety of precalculus courses. It is a comprehensive text that covers more ground than a typical one- or two-semester college-level precalculus course. The content is organized by clearly-defined learning objectives, and includes worked examples that demonstrate problem-solving approaches in an accessible way.\n</p><section data-depth=\"3\" id=\"eip-250\"><h5 data-type=\"title\">Coverage and Scope</h5><p id=\"eip-id1164242457359\"><em data-effect=\"italics\">Precalculus</em> contains twelve chapters, roughly divided into three groups. </p>\n<p id=\"eip-id1164239746735\">Chapters 1-4 discuss various types of functions, providing a foundation for the remainder of the course.\n</p><ul id=\"eip-id1168983371474\"><li>Chapter 1: Functions</li>\n<li>Chapter 2: Linear Functions</li>\n<li>Chapter 3: Polynomial and Rational Functions</li>\n<li>Chapter 4: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions</li></ul><p id=\"eip-id1164253943954\">Chapters 5-8 focus on Trigonometry. In <em data-effect=\"italics\">Precalculus</em>, we approach trigonometry by first introducing angles and the unit circle, as opposed to the right triangle approach more commonly used in college algebra and trigonometry courses.\n</p><ul id=\"eip-id7864342\"><li>Chapter 5: Trigonometric Functions</li>\n<li>Chapter 6: Periodic Functions</li>\n<li>Chapter 7: Trigonometric Identities and Equations</li>\n<li>Chapter 8: Further Applications of Trigonometry</li></ul><p id=\"eip-id1164239005230\">Chapters 9-12 present some advanced precalculus topics that build on topics introduced in chapters 1-8. Most precalculus syllabi include some of the topics in these chapters, but few include all. Instructors can select material as needed from this group of chapters, since they are not cumulative. </p><ul id=\"eip-id1166690773820\">\n<li>Chapter 9: Systems of Equations and Inequalities</li>\n<li>Chapter 10: Analytic Geometry</li>\n<li>Chapter 11: Sequences, Probability and Counting Theory</li>\n<li>Chapter 12: Introduction to Calculus</li></ul><p>\nAll chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the Table of Contents.</p></section><section data-depth=\"3\" id=\"eip-350\"><h5 data-type=\"title\">Development Overview</h5><p id=\"eip-377\"><em data-effect=\"italics\">Precalculus</em> is the product of a collaborative effort by a group of dedicated authors, editors, and instructors whose collective passion for this project has resulted in a text that is remarkably unified in purpose and voice. Special thanks is due to our Lead Author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University, who provided the overall vision for the book and oversaw the development of each and every chapter, drawing up the initial blueprint, reading numerous drafts, and assimilating field reviews into actionable revision plans for our authors and editors. </p><p id=\"eip-id1170058262242\">The first eight chapters are built on the foundation of <em data-effect=\"italics\">Precalculus: An Investigation of Functions</em> by David Lippman and Melonie Rasmussen. Chapters 9-12 were written and developed from by our expert and highly experienced <a href=\"#\">author team</a>. All twelve chapters follow a new and innovative instructional design, and great care has been taken to maintain a consistent voice from cover to cover. New features have been introduced to flesh out the instruction, all of the graphics have been redone in a more contemporary style, and much of the content has been revised, replaced, or supplemented to bring the text more in line with mainstream approaches to teaching precalculus.\n</p></section><section data-depth=\"3\" id=\"eip-42\"><h5 data-type=\"title\">Accuracy of the Content</h5><p id=\"eip-951\">We have taken great pains to ensure the validity and accuracy of this text. Each chapter&#8217;s manuscript underwent at least two rounds of review and revision by a panel of active precalculus instructors. Then, prior to publication, a separate team of experts checked all text, examples, and graphics for mathematical accuracy; multiple reviewers were assigned to each chapter to minimize the chances of any error escaping notice. A third team of experts was responsible for the accuracy of the Answer Key, dutifully reworking every solution to eradicate any lingering errors. Finally, the editorial team conducted a multi-round post-production review to ensure the integrity of the content in its final form was written and developed after the Student Edition, has also been rigorously checked for accuracy following a process similar to that described above. Incidentally, the act of writing out solutions step-by-step served as yet another round of validation for the Answer Key in the back of the Student Edition.</p></section><section data-depth=\"3\" id=\"eip-563\"><h5 data-type=\"title\">Pedagogical Foundations and Features</h5><section data-depth=\"4\" id=\"eip-61\"><h6 data-type=\"title\">Learning Objectives</h6><p id=\"eip-86\">Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional element.</p></section><section data-depth=\"4\" id=\"eip-719\"><h6 data-type=\"title\">Narrative Text</h6><p id=\"eip-784\">\nNarrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples.  Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:\n</p><ul id=\"eip-id1166658637533\"><li>Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.</li>\n<li>Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.</li>\n</ul></section><section data-depth=\"4\" id=\"eip-802\"><h6 data-type=\"title\">Example</h6><p id=\"eip-321\">Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples that demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective in order to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity. All told, there are more than 650 Examples, or an average of about 55 per chapter. </p><p id=\"eip-id1166796259369\">All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the Solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we conclude with an Analysis reflecting on the broader implications of the Solution just shown.\n</p></section><section data-depth=\"4\" id=\"eip-236\"><h6 data-type=\"title\">Figures</h6><p id=\"eip-829\"><em data-effect=\"italics\">Precalculus</em> contains more than 2000 figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.\n</p><span data-type=\"media\" id=\"preface01\" data-alt=\"Example figure\">\n\n  <img src=\"/resources/d77d2b526befaea426f25a78f13b3bcc4d993d60/CNX_Precalc_Figure_Preface_01.jpg\" data-media-type=\"image/jpeg\" alt=\"Example figure\"/>\n\n</span></section><section data-depth=\"4\" id=\"eip-22\"><h6 data-type=\"title\">Supporting Features</h6><p id=\"eip-503\">\nFour small but important features, each marked by a distinctive icon, serve to support Examples.\n</p>\n\n<ul id=\"eip-id1171887752668\"><li>\nA <strong data-effect=\"bold\"> How To</strong> is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.   </li>\n\n<li>\nA <strong data-effect=\"bold\">Try It</strong> exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem.  In the PDF and the Web View version of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key.</li>\n\n<li>\nA <strong data-effect=\"bold\">Q&amp;A</strong> may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.  </li>\n\n<li>\nThe <strong data-effect=\"bold\">Media</strong> icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises.
