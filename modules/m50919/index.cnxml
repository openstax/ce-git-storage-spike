  <md:title>Preface</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Precalculus is intended for college-level Precalculus students. Since Precalculus courses vary from one institution to the next, we have attempted to meet the needs of as broad an audience as possible, including all of the content that might be covered in any particular course. The result is a comprehensive book that covers more ground than an instructor could likely cover in a typical one- or two-semester course; but instructors should find, almost without fail, that the topics they wish to include in their syllabus are covered in the text.   Many chapters of Openstax Precalculus are suitable for other freshman and sophomore math courses such as College Algebra and Trigonometry; however, instructors of those courses might need to supplement or adjust the material. Openstax will also be releasing a College Algebra and Trigonometry title tailored to the particular scope, sequence, and pedagogy of those courses.</md:abstract>

It is a comprehensive text that covers more ground than a typical one- or two-semester college-level precalculus course. The content is organized by clearly-defined learning objectives, and includes worked examples that demonstrate problem-solving approaches in an accessible way.
</para><section id="eip-250"><title>Coverage and Scope</title><para id="eip-id1164242457359"><emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus</emphasis> contains twelve chapters, roughly divided into three groups. </para>
<para id="eip-id1164239746735">Chapters 1-4 discuss various types of functions, providing a foundation for the remainder of the course.

Most precalculus syllabi include some of the topics in these chapters, but few include all. Instructors can select material as needed from this group of chapters, since they are not cumulative. <list id="eip-id1166690773820">

All chapters are broken down into multiple sections, the titles of which can be viewed in the Table of Contents.</para></section><section id="eip-350"><title>Development Overview</title><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-377"><emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus</emphasis> is the product of a collaborative effort by a group of dedicated authors, editors, and instructors whose collective passion for this project has resulted in a text that is remarkably unified in purpose and voice. Special thanks is due to our Lead Author, Jay Abramson of Arizona State University, who provided the overall vision for the book and oversaw the development of each and every chapter, drawing up the initial blueprint, reading numerous drafts, and assimilating field reviews into actionable revision plans for our authors and editors. </para><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-id1170058262242">The first eight chapters are built on the foundation of <emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus: An Investigation of Functions</emphasis> by David Lippman and Melonie Rasmussen. Chapters 9-12 were written and developed from by our expert and highly experienced <link target-id="">author team</link>. All twelve chapters follow a new and innovative instructional design, and great care has been taken to maintain a consistent voice from cover to cover. New features have been introduced to flesh out the instruction, all of the graphics have been redone in a more contemporary style, and much of the content has been revised, replaced, or supplemented to bring the text more in line with mainstream approaches to teaching precalculus.
</para></section><section id="eip-42"><title>Accuracy of the Content</title><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-951">We have taken great pains to ensure the validity and accuracy of this text. Each chapter’s manuscript underwent at least two rounds of review and revision by a panel of active precalculus instructors. Then, prior to publication, a separate team of experts checked all text, examples, and graphics for mathematical accuracy; multiple reviewers were assigned to each chapter to minimize the chances of any error escaping notice. A third team of experts was responsible for the accuracy of the Answer Key, dutifully reworking every solution to eradicate any lingering errors. Finally, the editorial team conducted a multi-round post-production review to ensure the integrity of the content in its final form was written and developed after the Student Edition, has also been rigorously checked for accuracy following a process similar to that described above. Incidentally, the act of writing out solutions step-by-step served as yet another round of validation for the Answer Key in the back of the Student Edition.</para></section><section id="eip-563"><title>Pedagogical Foundations and Features</title><section id="eip-61"><title>Learning Objectives</title><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-86">Each chapter is divided into multiple sections (or modules), each of which is organized around a set of learning objectives. The learning objectives are listed explicitly at the beginning of each section and are the focal point of every instructional element.</para></section><section id="eip-719"><title xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute">Narrative Text</title><para id="eip-784">
Narrative text is used to introduce key concepts, terms, and definitions, to provide real-world context, and to provide transitions between topics and examples.  Throughout this book, we rely on a few basic conventions to highlight the most important ideas:
<list xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-id1166658637533"><item>Key terms are boldfaced, typically when first introduced and/or when formally defined.</item>
<item>Key concepts and definitions are called out in a blue box for easy reference.</item>
</list></para></section><section id="eip-802"><title>Example</title><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-321">Each learning objective is supported by one or more worked examples that demonstrate the problem-solving approaches that students must master. Typically, we include multiple Examples for each learning objective in order to model different approaches to the same type of problem, or to introduce similar problems of increasing complexity. All told, there are more than 650 Examples, or an average of about 55 per chapter. </para><para id="eip-id1166796259369">All Examples follow a simple two- or three-part format. First, we pose a problem or question. Next, we demonstrate the Solution, spelling out the steps along the way. Finally (for select Examples), we conclude with an Analysis reflecting on the broader implications of the Solution just shown.
</para></section><section id="eip-236"><title>Figures</title><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-829"><emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus</emphasis> contains more than 2000 figures and illustrations, the vast majority of which are graphs and diagrams. Art throughout the text adheres to a clear, understated style, drawing the eye to the most important information in each figure while minimizing visual distractions. Color contrast is employed with discretion to distinguish between the different functions or features of a graph.

Four small but important features, each marked by a distinctive icon, serve to support Examples.
</para>

<list id="eip-id1171887752668"><item>
A <emphasis effect="bold"> How To</emphasis> is a list of steps necessary to solve a certain type of problem. A How To typically precedes an Example that proceeds to demonstrate the steps in action.   </item>

<item>
A <emphasis effect="bold">Try It</emphasis> exercise immediately follows an Example or a set of related Examples, providing the student with an immediate opportunity to solve a similar problem.  In the PDF and the Web View version of the text, answers to the Try It exercises are located in the Answer Key.</item>

<item>
A <emphasis effect="bold">Q&amp;A</emphasis> may appear at any point in the narrative, but most often follows an Example. This feature pre-empts misconceptions by posing a commonly asked yes/no question, followed by a detailed answer and explanation.  </item>

<item>
The <emphasis effect="bold">Media</emphasis> icon appears at the conclusion of each section, just prior to the Section Exercises. This icon marks a list of links to online video tutorials that reinforce the concepts and skills introduced in the section. </item></list><para id="eip-165">While we have selected tutorials that closely align to our learning objectives, we did not produce these tutorials, nor were they specifically produced or tailored to accompany <emphasis effect="italics">Precalculus</emphasis>. </para></section><section id="eip-166"><title>Section Exercises</title><para xmlns:data="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#custom-data-attribute" id="eip-526">Each section of every chapter concludes with a well-rounded set of exercises that can be assigned as homework or used selectively for guided practice.
