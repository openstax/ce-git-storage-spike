# Validation

Then, you can open a cnxml file in the [modules/](./modules/) directory and try to remove attributes (like `id="..."`) to see validation errors pop up or add content to see autocompletion options.


# Preview

To see what Previewing looks like, click the Preview button on the top-right of the editor just below and to the left of your avatar. 

It might be invisible; if so, you can open the README.md file and click the preview button. That is in the same place as the invisible button.

If that does not work you may need to install the `openstax.editor` extension:

1. Open the Extensions Panel by clicking the Square-ish icon in the left side of the window (just below the Bug with a circle and a slash through it)
1. Either search for `openstax.editor` or obtain a `.vsix` file from a developer from [ce-git-code-spike](https://github.com/openstax/ce-git-code-spike) and drag-and-dropping the file into the Panel
1. Open a `.cnxml` file


# Dashboard

To see what a dashboard could kind o look like, install the Git Graph extension by doing the following:

1. Click the Square-ish icon in the left side of the window (just below the Bug with a circle and a slash through it)
1. Type `git graph` into the text box taht appeared under "EXTENSIONS: OPEN VSX REGISTRY"
1. Press `[Install]`
1. Click the `Git Graph` words at the bottom of the window in the horizontal blue bar
