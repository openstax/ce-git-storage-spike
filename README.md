Darth Vader was here. 

# Validation

Then, you can open a cnxml file in the [modules/](./modules/) directory and try to remove attributes (like `id="..."`) to see validation errors pop up or add content to see autocompletion options.


# Preview

To see what Previewing looks like, open a CNXML file and click the Preview button on the top-right of the editor just below and to the left of your avatar. 

It might be invisible; if so, you can open the README.md file and click the preview button. That is in the same place as the invisible button.


# Dashboard

A dashboard shows up when you open a CNXML file (demo bug). The current one is a mockup; it is intended to show the following:

- All the books that are in the repository with a way to add/remove/rename/reorder books
- The Table of Contents of a book with a way to:
    - add/rename/remove/reorder items in the Table of Contents
    - seeing who has the files open
    - a link to edit the file
